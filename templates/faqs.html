                    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-green-800 mb-2">How often should I water my plants?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Watering frequency depends on the plant type, pot size, soil, and environment. Generally, check soil moisture by inserting your finger 1-2 inches deep. Water when the top inch feels dry for most houseplants, while succulents need less frequent watering. Outdoor plants typically need 1-2 inches of water per week.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-green-800 mb-2">What's the best location/lighting for plants?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Most plants need bright, indirect light. South-facing windows provide the most light, while north-facing windows offer gentle, indirect light. Read plant tags carefully - "full sun" means 6+ hours of direct sunlight, "partial shade" means 3-6 hours, and "full shade" means less than 3 hours of direct sun.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-green-800 mb-2">When is the best time to plant/transplant?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Spring and fall are ideal for most planting. Spring planting allows plants to establish before summer heat, while fall planting gives roots time to develop before winter. Avoid transplanting during extreme weather or when plants are flowering or fruiting.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-green-800 mb-2">How do I know if my plant is getting too much or too little water?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Overwatering signs: yellow leaves, mushy stems, fungal growth, or soggy soil. Underwatering signs: wilting, dry/crispy leaves, or soil pulling away from pot edges. Always check soil moisture rather than following a rigid schedule.</p>
